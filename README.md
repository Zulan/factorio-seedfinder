# Finding seeds with the headless version of factorio

Edit all.sh / single.sh according to the range of seeds you want to map and the amount of parallel instances. The server version generates no screenshots - to get screenshots you must run with the gui / a player.

# Requirements

factorio 0.15.x
gnu parallel (if using all.sh)
